'''this is a container for the voting data. It takes the hash of the address + full name + date.
Use now() to keep track of the date, and hash the date separately as well.
the container should also have a secondary internal container containing their votes.
lastly it should have an equal and separate container that holds the politicians or whatever being voted for have their names listed.
Can hold multiple entries for different positions.
use position as a secondary measure to make sure everything is ready.'''
